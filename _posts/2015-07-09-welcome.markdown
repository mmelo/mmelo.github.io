  The past few months I've been quite a busy chap. Mostly, I was preparing a few webapps at work, but
  now things are looking a bit more on the calm side so I thought I could use a simple blog just to start
  sharing a few ideas and front-end related stuff I've been busy with.

My name is Miguel and i work at [INM](http://inm.pt) on the Front-End WebDevelopment Team as a developer and a Team-Leader, and
my work usualy consists in defining our website and webapp architectures as well as developing them.
\\
\\
The work I do nowadays revolves around making Backbone apps but recently I started playing with
Jekyll and from there I thought it might be a good idea to start a blog where I could share a few of the challenges,
tips, tricks and solutions I find along the way.
Most of the posts you will be able to find here will often be about webapp performance (#perfmatters), i.e., making both the
UX and the loading times as fast and smooth as I can possibly muster.
\\

I hope someone will find some of the content I'll be posting here usefull. Please stay tunned as I promise I'll try to keep
things updated around here.
